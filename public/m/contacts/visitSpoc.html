From today's featured article
Jumping Flash! is a platform video game co-developed by Exact and Ultra and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The first instalment in the Jumping Flash! series, it was released in April 1995 for the PlayStation in Japan and later the same year in Europe and North America; it was re-released through the PlayStation Network store on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in 2007. Presented in a first-person perspective, the game follows a robotic rabbit named Robbit as he searches for missing jet pods that have been scattered by the game's antagonist character, the astrophysicist Baron Aloha. The game has been described as an early showcase for 3D graphics in console gaming. Generally well received by critics, who praised its graphics and unique gameplay, it was later overshadowed by 3D platformers of the fifth console generation. It was described as the third-most underrated video game of all time by Matt Casamassina of IGN in 2007,
